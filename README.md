# 🛡️ RoadSentinel: Intelligent Road & Environment Incident Detection

## 🚩 Problem Definition
> **The Core Problem:** The critical vulnerability of urban road infrastructure to unpredictable environmental and industrial disasters.

Current urban systems are characterized by sudden **ground crashes, pipeline explosions, floods, falling debris, and fire outbreaks**. Crucially, emergency services currently lack the automated, real-time situational awareness required to assess the severity of these unstructured hazards instantly.

## 💡 Our Solution
We aim to secure road networks against non-vehicular threats through **intelligent visual monitoring systems**.

By developing a computer vision-based anomaly detection framework, the system will:
1.  **Identify** complex environmental incidents.
2.  **Estimate** the scale of damage (impact area).
3.  **Generate** recommended mitigation actions to support emergency decision-making.
